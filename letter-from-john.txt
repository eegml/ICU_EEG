Hello Chris,

Thank you for your interest, and I apologize for those GitHub issues. There are some subjects in the repository which were not ultimately used in the published form of this project (in particular, anything with 'IIC' in it - these were interictal - ictal continuum patients which we did not want to use in training the model), as well as a few others which clinicians on our team judged to have insufficient data quality. We also had to re-upload files recently under new IDs on ieeg.org for deidentification purposes which may have made some of the annotation files fail. 

If it is okay with you, I can re-check your issue and clean up a few things on the GitHub next week. I'll get back to you next week when this is complete.

Best,

John
